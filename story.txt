Once upon a time, there were three little elves who lived in a mountain. Their names are Legolas, Tauriel, and Elrond. 

One day they received a special ring, and they decided to call that ring the "One Ring."

That ring had magic powers that allowed anyone to bypass DUO multifactor authentication. Upon receiving the ring, they had a bitter debate about who should keep it.
Nobody liked DUO, so they all wanted the ring. That creepy little bird invaded their dreams at night and gave them nightmares. One of these days, they would forget
their iPhones and they would be unable to get what they wanted from their phones!
